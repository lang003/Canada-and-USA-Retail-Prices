# Technique and Notes: 
Use SAS or R Studio to clean and merge all the CSVs, and then use Tableau BI for presenation. 
Not all products will be shown once merged.
One Gram is equal to One Milliliters for solid and liquid conversions. 
Canada's csv will need additional cleaning due to their inconsistent measurements and their monthly cost per product in 2022.
The USD conversion in Canadian Dollars is 1 USD= 1.30 Candian Dollar on average for 2022. Manually cleaned and organize the shared products in both USA and CANADA files, and finding the cost for Product in Kg in USD and Canadian Dollars. 
Upload the excel sheet onto Tableau BI and pull the variables into rows and collumns. Note Sankey is found in additional extentions and grouping is in Analyze in Tableau BI. 
  Thank you!
